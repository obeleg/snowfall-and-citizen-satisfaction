## Introduction
In recent years, municipalities have increasingly recognized the importance of citizen feedback in shaping policies and services. Community surveys serve as invaluable tools for gauging citizen satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement within local administrations. Among these municipalities, the City of Naperville stands out for its proactive approach to soliciting resident feedback through periodic community surveys.

This project presents an overview of the 2016 Naperville Community Survey findings, focusing on assessing citizen satisfaction with snow removal and road maintenanceâ€”crucial services given the region's susceptibility to inclement weather.

The analysis aims to provide insights crucial for enhancing service delivery and community well-being, particularly within the Public Works department responsible for snow removal.
